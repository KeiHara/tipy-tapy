## Use Activity Component for Show/Hide

> **Note:** `<Activity>` is an **experimental API** available only in React's canary/experimental builds (`react@experimental`, `react-dom@experimental`). It is not available in stable React releases.

Use React's `<Activity>` to preserve state/DOM for expensive components that frequently toggle visibility.

**Usage:**

```tsx
import { Activity } from "react";

function Dropdown({ isOpen }: Props) {
  return (
    <Activity mode={isOpen ? "visible" : "hidden"}>
      <ExpensiveMenu />
    </Activity>
  );
}
```

Avoids expensive re-renders and state loss.
